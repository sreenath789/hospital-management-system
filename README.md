<br>

## Framework Used
* Spring Boot

---
<br>

## Dependencies
The following dependencies are required to run the project:

* Spring Boot Dev Tools
* Spring Web
* Spring Data JPA
* MySQL Driver
* Lombok
* Validation
* Swagger

<br>

## Database Configuration
To connect to a MySQL database, update the application.properties file with the appropriate database URL, username, and password. The following properties need to be updated:
```
spring.datasource.driverClassName=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
spring.datasource.url = jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/<DatabaseName>
spring.datasource.username = <userName>
spring.datasource.password = <password>
spring.jpa.show-sql = true
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto = update

spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.show_sql=true
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.use_sql_comments=true
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.format_sql=true

```
<br>

## Language Used
* Java

---
<br>

## Data Model

The Job data model is defined in the Job class, which has the following attributes:
<br>

* Doctor Model
```
 @Id
 @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
 private int doctorId;
 @Size(min=3)
 private String name;
 private String city;
 @Email
 private String email;
 @Length(min=10,max=10,message = "Enter a valid phone number")
 private String phoneNumber;
 private String speciality;
```

* Patient Model
```
 @Id
 @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
 private int pateintId;
 @Size(min=3)
 private String name;
 private String city;
 @Email
 private String email;
 @Length(min=10,max=10,message = "Enter a valid phone number")
 private String phoneNumber;
 private String symptom;
```


## Data Flow

1. The user at client side sends a request to the application through the API endpoints.
2. The API receives the request and sends it to the appropriate controller method.
3. The controller method makes a call to the method in service class.
4. The method in service class builds logic and retrieves or modifies data from the database, which is in turn given to controller class
5. The controller method returns a response to the API.
6. The API sends the response back to the user.

## API End Points

The following endpoints are available in the API:

* Doctor Controller:
```
POST /doctor/doctor: create a new doctor
GET /doctor/doctors : get the all doctors
GET /doctor/doctor/id : get the doctor by id
DELETE /doctor/doctor/id : delete the doctor by id 
```

* Patient Controller:
```
POST /patient/patient: create a new patient
GET /patient/patients : get the all patients
GET /patient/patient/id : get the patient by id
DELETE /patient/patient/id : delete the patient by id 
```

## DataBase Used
* SQL database
```
We have used Persistent database to implement CRUD Operations.
```
